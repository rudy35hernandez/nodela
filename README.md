# Nodela

A full stack web app that allows users to post their Nodelas (play on the word Novela), dramatized Node.js stories that may
have drove them crazy, and what the solution was. This is a perfect tool to look back at situations that really had you stumped. 
Other users can chime in to share similar accounts, and how they were able to solve their Nodela. Retelling your problem in story form,
and giving a step by step explanation really helps you recall the situation and solution should you ever encounter it again.
Ultimately, this is a social but educational application that will help developers thrive!
