Nodela

A full stack web app that allows users to post their Nodelas (play on the word Novela), dramatized Node.js stories that may
have drove them crazy, and what the solution was. This is a perfect tool to look back at situations that really had you stumped, 
and it also helps you review what the solution was! Other users can chime in and give advice, or share a similar Nodela. 
Ultimately, this is a social but educational application that will help developers thrive!

---------------- SMALL NOTES ----------------------------

The application is now allowing comments from all users, and comments are now able to be deleted by its user.
Likes for each comment will be next on my list. Also, some styling will be changed for the posts soon!
